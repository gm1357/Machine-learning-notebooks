# Machine-learning-notebooks

Jupyter notebooks and datasets used to study machine learning following the Nanodegree of machine learning from Udacity.

The Nanodegree consisted of three months of study on the subject of machine learning using python. The topics were divided in three: Supervised Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning with clusters. At the end of each section it's given a project to test the skills learned. The developed projects can be found at the following links (except the third one, that used data from a real company, and therefore can't be show):

 - [Finding Donors](projects-exercises/Finding-Donors)
 - [Image Classifier](projects-exercises/Image-Classifier)
